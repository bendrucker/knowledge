## Psychology

### Decisions

Decisions should be assessed along two axes:

* **Frequency**: is this a one time choice, or one that's likely to recur?
* **Magnitude**: how large is the impact of each individual decision on me?

Decisions are likely to be:

1. High frequency, low magnitude
2. Low frequency, low magnitude
3. Low frequency, high magnitude

No framework can successfully cope with high frequency, high magnitude decisions so they should be avoided entirely.

##### High frequency, low magnitude

*Examples*: What to eat, when to wake up, how to exercise, what to wear

Strive for consistency and re-evaluate on a predetermined recurring basis. Develop a sizable data set before amending a routine. 

##### Low frequency, low magnitude

*Examples*: What to order at a restaurant, where to go on vacation

Optimize for decision speed. Maintain a queue of pre-made choices (restaurants to try, places to go) and pull from it sequentially where possible. When a choice is truly spontaneous, add a constraint (first place, first thought).

##### Low frequency, high magnitude

*Examples*: Where to live, what to work on, relationships

Perform quantitative evaluation first where possible, but acknowledge that many high magnitude decisions will lack a clear right answer. Frame decisions around authoring future identity rather than attemtping to deconstruct options and compare like attributes.
